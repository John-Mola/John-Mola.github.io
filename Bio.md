I am a USGS Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow advised by Dr. Ian Pearse in Fort Collins, Colorado (although I will be working remotely until January 2020 in Davis, California still!). 

My research focuses on a variety of questions within pollinator ecology and conservation, usually with an emphasis on bumble bees, fire ecology, and the use of conservation genetics methods. I recently completed my PhD in Ecology with [Dr. Neal Williams](http://williamslab.ucdavis.edu) at University of California Davis. 

This website functions as my personal/professional website for hosting summaries of my research, a list of publications, and whatever little bits I feel like blogging about. You can find more information on my research at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r9e-7i0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page. I will soon add a link to my USGS research profile when that is available.  

In my non-professional capacity, I enjoy playing music, ultimate frisbee, video games, [hanging out with my dog](#dog), and being around people who are equally cynical and sarcastic. 

Please get in touch with me if you want to talk bees, genetics, fire, or if you notice any site errors. I am fairly active on twitter if that's your thing: [@_JohnMola](https://twitter.com/_JohnMola).
