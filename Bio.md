I am a USGS Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow advised by [Dr. Ian Pearse](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/ian-pearse?qt-staff_profile_science_products=3#qt-staff_profile_science_products) in Fort Collins, Colorado. 

My research focuses on a variety of questions within pollinator ecology and conservation, often with an emphasis on bumble bees, fire ecology, and the use of conservation genetics methods. I recently completed my PhD in Ecology with [Dr. Neal Williams](http://williamslab.ucdavis.edu) at University of California Davis in 2019. 

This website functions as my personal/professional website for hosting summaries of my research, a list of publications, and whatever little bits I feel like blogging about. You can find more information on my research at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r9e-7i0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page. I will soon add a link to my USGS research profile when that is available.  


Please get in touch with me if you want to talk about any of the above interests or if you notice any site errors. I am fairly active on twitter if that's your thing: [@_JohnMola](https://twitter.com/_JohnMola).
