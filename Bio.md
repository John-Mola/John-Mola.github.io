I am a USGS Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow advised by [Dr. Ian Pearse](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/ian-pearse?qt-staff_profile_science_products=3#qt-staff_profile_science_products) in Fort Collins, Colorado. 

My research focuses on a variety of questions within applied ecology and conservation - often with a focus on pollinators and especially bumble bees. Broadly I am interested in plant-insect interactions, fire ecology, and the use of conservation genetics methods to solve problems. I completed my PhD in Ecology with [Dr. Neal Williams](http://williamslab.ucdavis.edu) at University of California Davis in 2019. 

Please check out my [Resources](/resources) page. If you're an early career researcher, or advise early career scientists, you may be interested in our Slack Workspace or database of early career pollinat* ecologists. Additionally, I am part of a Social Justice in Ecology Reading Group that is open to all interested. Details on the [resources](/resources) page. 

This website functions as my personal/professional website for hosting summaries of my research, a list of publications, and whatever little bits I feel like blogging about. You can find more information on my research at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r9e-7i0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page. You can find my official USGS staff profile [here](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/john-m-mola).


Please get in touch with me if you want to talk about any of the above interests or if you notice any site errors. I am fairly active on twitter if that's your thing: [@_JohnMola](https://twitter.com/_JohnMola).
