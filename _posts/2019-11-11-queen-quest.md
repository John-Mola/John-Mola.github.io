## Have you ever wondered where bumble bees go overwinter?

Well, so have we! Introducing, #QueenQuest!

QueenQuest is a community science effort that I am spearheading along with folks from Xerces Society, University of Vermont, University of Nebraska, and more. We're getting researchers and community members out to look for overwintering bumble bee habitat. 

Read more about it at the [Queen Quest website](https://www.queenquest.org/). 

And guess what? We're already having success with Dr. Michelle Duenne's students finding overwintering *Bombus impatiens* out east!
