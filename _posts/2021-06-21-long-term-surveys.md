Bumble bees are highly mobile species that sometimes have really long flight seasons that span the blooming period of multiple habitat types. In a new study published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, we used long-term data from Illinois to look at how food plants used by bumble bees have chnaged over time across different habitats. We find that despite peak food availability occurring in grasslands, forests provide the earliest abundance of food when queens are out foraging. However, these important early-season foods are in decline.

<!--Maybe I want this to be more resource-limitation focused?-->
