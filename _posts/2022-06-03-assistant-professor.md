I am quite pleased to say I'm starting as an Assistant Professor at Colorado State University in the department of Forest and Rangeland Stewardship in October 2022!

No particular update at the moment other than just a heads up that I'll be recruiting folks looking to work on the relationships between bees and forest/woodland habitats, pollen use within urban environments, fire ecology, and more. Aka: Bees, trees, and cities.
