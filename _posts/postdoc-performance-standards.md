After a little over a year with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), I thought I would write up some thoughts of common things people ask about. Specifically, when I tell grad students and postdocs about my "performance review" - they seem really interested.

At some point I intend to write a bit more about my experience as a "USGS Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow" - how I got the position, salary and benefits, day to day, etc. I have not gotten around to that yet - if you want to discuss at length, email me and we can set up a time. 

However - I have had quite a few conversations with graduate students or postdocs about my position so far and something that intrigues people repeatedly is the yearly "performance review" that we conduct at USGS. As somewhat intimidating as a yearly evaluation can be, I think it's a net positive. One reason for that: **clear performance standards**

We have performance standards that are handed to us as federal scientists. I don't know exactly how they are determined, but I basically had to sign off on them - saying that those are my targets and I will hit them. Maybe some people find that strange and formal. Personally, I find it really helpful to have clear guidelines about expectations. I think Individual Development Plans are really important for students and mentors to develop together and a performance review is sort of just like that but more general. 

First - I only have one year of experience in government. I'm not an expert on this and some of it is a bit opaque, but this post is my attempt at translating them for others to reference. 

The performance review process basically works like this:

  - We have standards that relate to our research grade and job title
  - We do our work all year
  - We submit a performance review document to our Branch Chief (sort of like a department chair)
  - They look that document over
  - We discuss the document together
  - We receive our evaluation (and potentially a cash or vacation time bonus. Neat!)
  
For my review, there are four different categories. Each category has different criteria. You receive a grade in each category of one of four outcomes:

  - Outstanding
  - Exceeds expectations
  - Full satisfactory
  - Not satisfactory **LOOK UP THIS ACTUAL WORDING**
  
My performance review consists of the following four categories:
