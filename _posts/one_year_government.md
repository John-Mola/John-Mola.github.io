After a little over a year with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), I thought I would write up some thoughts

<img src="../img/posts/IMG_6385.JPG">

At the time of this writing, I have been a "USGS Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow" for a little over a year. I began my position remotely at the end of October 2019, moved to Fort Collins, Colorado in January of 2020 where I worked for about two months in an office and then have worked from home since due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I thought it would be useful for current graduate students, or those otherwise considering a career in government to hear some thoughts. Obviously I do not have a long track-record in government science, *and my experience is heavily altered by the chaos of this year*, but I haven't seen a ton written about the "government life" and thought people would be interested. 

Because this is a post about government research, I'll start with a cheeky but maybe obligatory: these are my person views, provided in my non-professional capacity, and do not represent any opinions, recommendations, or official position of the U.S. federal government. :P

Honestly, this post became kinda-long because I had a lot I wanted to blather about. Here's a handy clickable list to skip to a section of interest:

[INSERT LIST]

## Getting the job

I have been asked a few times about how I landed my current position. I know of many great scientists in graduate school who maybe had previous government experience and planned to return to a federal position when they completed their degree. I did not necessarily plan on a position in government after graduate school. 

In my fifth year at UC Davis I was a part of the Professors for the Future program. They encouraged us to conduct informational interviews and to explore career options besides "traditional" academic tracks. In that spirit, I had a short chat with Rich Hatfield of Xerces Society and another supposed-to-be-short-but-turned-into-multiple-hours chat with Ian Pearse at USGS.

I intended just to ask Ian about what it was like to work in government, whether he liked the agency, what his day to day was like, etc. We chatted about that, but then Ian mentioned he would be hiring a postdoc to work on Rusty Patched Bumble Bee projects in the near future and that I should consider applying. So, basically, I did. For the USGS Mendenhall program, you have to submit a competitive proposal based around a topic area. Without detailing the program here, basically the USGS advertises a variety of research areas they will hire postdocs for and then you submit a proposal within that research domain. I am happy to provide anyone with my proposal if you're curious. 

After submitting my proposal, it went through a HR filter, likely was seen by a few people, evaluated, and then ultimately selected. Ian and I worked on the proposal together - so in some ways it's sort of like having the "project" accepted rather than a particular researcher. Overall, I'm not sure that my particular experience "getting the job" is going to apply to a lot of people...but I think the main point is that informational interviews are the absolute best thing you can do to "generate your own coincidences" (a phrase from a author-carpenter I always admired). 

**What is probably a universal experience with getting a government job**...is how freaking long it took to work its way through the system. I basically had known that I was selected in ~June 2019. Then I had to make a mad dash to finish my PhD in time to have degree-in-hand for September. USGS requires it to actually say on your transcript that you have a PhD to be hired at the GS-12 level (my "grade"). After a whole set of shenanigans around that, worry that the offer would expire or something, background checks, fingerprinting, etc...it all came together and I began my job in late October 2019. Ian was super accomodating about me working remotely at first (in retrospect, a sort of funny sentiment given we are all remote now) but I had to physically be present in Colorado on my first day of work to receive my computer, access codes, etc.

## Day to day, projects, and "my mission"


## Salary, funding, and grants

## Work-life balance

## Government bureaucracy and paperwork
